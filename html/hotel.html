        &#x2022; This system allows administrators to submit folios, add passengers, and make reservations. <br><br>
        &#x2022; Administrators can view the status of all rooms, whether they are empty, reserved, or full. <br><br>
        &#x2022; The system provides multiple tables and charts that offer comprehensive information about passengers,
        reservations, and more. <br><br>
        &#x2022; There are two options for submitting reservations: half-day reservations and full-day reservations.
        <br><br>
        &#x2022; Administrators log in using their own credentials, and there is a super admin who controls everything.
